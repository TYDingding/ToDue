ToDue App
by Dylan Pardo, Huilin Ou, Mavis Hou, Wesley Yin and Yiding Tao

Utility:
This app builds upon the functionality of existing productivity apps, with features our group believes would improve our own productivity.

Functionality:
- Users can create, edit, and delete Todues with the following Data:
    - Title
    - Date/Time
    - Priority Level
    - Location
    - Description
- Users can see visual representation of the time left on a Todue through the progress bar
    - Similar to Gradescope
- Users can mark a Todue as complete
- Users can filter their displayed Todue list for only high priority Todues
- User's current Todues show up in Apple calendars
    - Edits or deletes to Todues show up in the calendar (calendar is always synced with state of Todues in app)
- Todues persist across runs of the app (using UserDefaults to store)
